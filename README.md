Restart HomeBridge.

## Setup Development Environment

To develop Homebridge plugins you must have Node.js 12 or later installed, and a modern code editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This plugin template uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to make development easier and comes with pre-configured settings for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and ESLint. If you are using VS Code install these extensions:

* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

### Install Development Dependencies

Using a terminal, navigate to the project folder and run this command to install the development dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Build Plugin

TypeScript needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can run. The following command will compile the contents of your [`src`](./src) directory and put the resulting code into the `dist` folder.

```
npm run build
```

### Link To Homebridge

Run this command so your global install of Homebridge can discover the plugin in your development environment:

```
npm link
```

You can now start Homebridge, use the `-D` flag so you can see debug log messages in your plugin:

```
homebridge -D
```

### Watch For Changes and Build Automatically

If you want to have your code compile automatically as you make changes, and restart Homebridge automatically between changes you can run:

```
npm run watch
```

This will launch an instance of Homebridge in debug mode which will restart every time you make a change to the source code. It will load the config stored in the default location under `~/.homebridge`. You may need to stop other running instances of Homebridge while using this command to prevent conflicts. You can adjust the Homebridge startup command in the [`nodemon.json`](./nodemon.json) file.
